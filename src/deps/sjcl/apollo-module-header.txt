 * SJCL used to be in the public domain.  Now it's:
 *
 * Copyright 2009-2010 Emily Stark, Mike Hamburg, Dan Boneh, Stanford University.
 *
 * This is for liability reasons.  (Speaking of which, SJCL comes with NO
 * WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, express or implied, to the limit of applicable
 * law.)
 * 
 * SJCL is dual-licensed under the GNU GPL version 2.0 or higher, and a
 * 2-clause BSD license.  You may use SJCL under the terms of either of
 * these licenses.  For your convenience, the GPL versions 2.0 and 3.0
 * and the 2-clause BSD license are included here.  Additionally, you may
 * serve "crunched" copies of sjcl (i.e. those with comments removed,
 * and other transformations to reduce code size) without any copyright
 * notice.
 * 
 * SJCL includes JsDoc toolkit, YUI compressor, Closure compressor,
 * JSLint and the CodeView template in its build system.  These programs'
 * copyrights are owned by other people.  They are distributed here under
 * the MPL, MIT, BSD, Apache and JSLint licenses.  Codeview is "free for
 * download" but has no license attached; it is Copyright 2010 Wouter Bos.
 * 
 * The BSD license is (almost?) strictly more permissive, but the
 * additionally licensing under the GPL allows us to use OCB 2.0 code
 * royalty-free (at least, if OCB 2.0's creator Phil Rogaway has anything
 * to say about it).  Note that if you redistribute SJCL under a license
 * other than the GPL, you or your users may need to pay patent licensing
 * fees for OCB 2.0.
 *
 * There may be patents which apply to SJCL other than Phil Rogaway's OCB
 * patents.  We suggest that you consult legal counsel before using SJCL
 * in a commercial project. *
